# One Health Continuum

Code for the paper _Comparative diversity of microbiomes and resistomes in beef feedlots, downstream environments and urban sewage influent_.

The purpose of this study was to analyze microbiomes and resistomes of beef production systems and associated environments across the One Health continuum.

The code in this repository is to analyze data processed with the AMR++ pipeline. Our team developed a Galaxy workflow with modifications to the original AMR++ workflow.
